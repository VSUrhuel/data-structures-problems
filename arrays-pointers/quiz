I. Create a program and its flowchart of the following requirements:
	1. Program that prints the Prime Number between 100 and 1000;
	2. Program that calculate the money after four years, with 1800.00 deposit at a rate of 2% and compounded annually, using the formula of Pe^(rt), where P is the principal amount r is the rate and t is the time.
	3. Given the following values in inches, display the Area of a Trapezoid:
		a. base1 = 4, base2 = 2, height = 4;
		b. base1 = 7, base2 = 3, height = 5;
		c. base1 = 2, base2 = 5, height = 7;

II. Trace the output and explain the program:
	1. int a=0, b=7, c=1;

		while(a<10)
		{
			c *= b;;
			display c;
			a++;
		}
		display c;
		END

	2. int a = 2, b = 10, c = 0, d = 28;

		while(d > 0)
		{
			d -= a;
			c++;
		}
		display c;
		END;

III. Fill the blanks in the code and explain the program:
	1. Program that displays the sum of reciprocal of a number in range:
		int a = 1, b = 10;
		float sum = __;

		while(____)
		{
			sum += ____;
			b--;
		}
		display sum;
		END;

	2. Program that displays the factorial of a number;
		int a = 7, prod = __;

		while(a > 0);
		{
			____;
			____;
		}
		______;
		END;
